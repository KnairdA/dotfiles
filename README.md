# Dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of configuration files of my system.

For managing dotfiles using symlinks I can recommend [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

See [_Tinkering with meta tools_](https://blog.kummerlaender.eu/article/tinkering_with_meta_tools/) for a detailed description of this setup.
